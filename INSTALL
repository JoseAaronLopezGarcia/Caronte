- Deploying the server

Option A)
Using Django itself to serve Caronte.
1. cd to the project folder (where manage.py is located)
2. python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8008 & >> ~/caronte_log.txt

Option B)
Using Nginx or Apache.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/
https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html

Either option is equally valid as Caronte is designed to work over unsecure HTTP connections.
