*** 0.1:
	- Initial project planning and design

*** 0.2:
	- Created initial user model
	- Created initial API for registration, basic login and logout
	- Created initial cryptographic functionality with password derivation for secure storage

*** 0.3:
	- Created Web sample

*** 0.4
	- Created initial challenge-response handshake
	- Created token generation annd verification functions

*** 0.5
	- Created independent client libraries for cryptographic operations and protocol

*** 0.6
	- First stable version with challenge-response and ticket generation

*** 0.7
	- Added anti-replay attack protection and password strength calculation
	- Tickets can now expire from usage

*** 0.8
	- Added protection against user password bruteforce attacks
	- Enforced protection on replay attacks by denying communications encrypted using the User IV
		This does not apply to second-stage of the handshake where token must still be encrypted with User IV
	- User information retrieved from the API is now encrypted
	- API now allows for secure user update (including password reset)
		This update is instant and doesn't require a re-login
		Even if you change the user's password, there's no need to refresh the user token or the session
	- Improvements to the Web Sample that showcases how Caronte tickets work.
		It also now allows to change user name and password on the fly, showing that no reload/relogin is required
	- Initial protection against Man-In-The-Middle attacks
	
*** 0.8.1
	- Caronte now authenticates itself to the user by issuing signed tokens (tickets)
	- Several changes to web sample and web client libraries
	- Simplified API and ticket handling
	- Removed basic authentication API and code

*** 0.9
	- Authentication process with Caronte has been reduced to only one API call and one parameter (email)
	- Cleaned up API and code: removed PUT methods from /crauth/ and /validate/
	- Ported CaronteSecurity and CaronteClient libraries to C
	- Updated client libraries for Java and Python

*** 0.9.1
	- Added anti reverse brute-force attack prevention
		Caronte now returns fake tickets when attempt to login with fake account.
	- Improved ticket handling code and verification
	- Cleaned up code in the API
	- Added maximum number of tickets that can be issued using the same token
